<center><h1>Welcome all to my first website MOTORCYCLE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FESTIVAL!</h1></center>
<br>
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motorcycle festival is about to invite people to the MOTORCYCLE FESTIVAL. This website is for motorcycle enthusiasts and festival! It's designed to be a friendly place.  The attention of the advanced public is also attracted by festivals that combine music and various spiritual practices: the so-called "spaces" for self-development and communication with like-minded people.
Of course, the main attraction for the audience is the content. Connoisseurs are eager to find out what the organizer has to offer them. And in the case of music festivals - who can he offer. And here the priority of goals and objectives again comes into force. The situation is twofold: on the one hand, the desire for commercial success of the project, to reach a wider audience dictates the need to invite sonorous names, on the other hand, the audience may be interested and often interested in everything new, including new performers.
The real attraction of this fiesta is the “bike show and music”, goodwill and a convivial atmosphere for all. From bikers to non-bikers or even aspiring bikers, visitors, tourists, families and locals, BikeFest has something for all. The festival allure can best be described by broad smiles and good humour as everyone soaks up the atmosphere in the Bike Camp located hear the town centre, on the Nikolaev Road, in the grounds of the Dom Pavlovyh Hotel.  Add in an action-packed, fun-fueled programme of events and activities, lots of live music stages day and night, coupled with the opportunity to ride the twisting tracks around the town.</h4>
